Write this on EXCEL and then covert it to csv file and put it in the project (if you want to)
This is basically testing data, you could modify it to be more precise.
NOTE A: MAKE SURE 'text' AND 'department' MUST BE IN LOWER-CASE and should be the headings of the cells (aka A1 cell is 'text' and B1 cell is 'department', then type the other text respectively) 
NOTE B: File name should be exact (civic_complaints when saving it as csv file)
